# Project Title (e.g., VadikAi Backend)

## 1. Overview

*(Provide a brief introduction to your project. What problem does it solve? What are its main goals?)*

**Example:**
`This project is the backend service for VadikAi, providing APIs for [mention key functionalities, e.g., user management, data processing, etc.].`

### 1.1. Key Features

*   *(List the main features of your application, e.g., User authentication, Product management, Order processing)*
*   Feature B
*   Feature C

### 1.2. Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** (e.g., Node.js, Express.js, Python, Django, Java, Spring Boot)
*   **Database:** (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
*   **Authentication:** (e.g., JWT, OAuth2)
*   **Deployment:** AWS EC2 (via GitHub Actions)
*   *(List any other relevant technologies or libraries)*

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1. Prerequisites

*   Node.js (e.g., v18.x or later) - *Adjust version as needed*
*   npm (e.g., v9.x or later) or yarn
*   Git
*   Access to an instance of [Your Database, e.g., MongoDB]
*   (Any other software or tools required to run the project)

### 2.2. Installation & Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd VadikAi-backend # Or your project directory name
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file (if you have one):
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Update the `.env` file with your local configuration (database URI, API keys, secrets, etc.).
    *   `DATABASE_URL=`
    *   `JWT_SECRET=`
    *   `PORT= (e.g., 3000)`

4.  **Run the application (development mode):**
    ```bash
    npm run dev # Or your script for development
    # Or
    # npm start
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:[PORT]`.

## 3. API Documentation

*(This is a crucial section. You'll need to document each API endpoint. If you use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI, you can link to that documentation here. Otherwise, describe them manually.)*

### 3.1. Authentication

*(Describe how API authentication works. E.g., "All protected endpoints require a Bearer token in the Authorization header. Obtain a token via the `/auth/login` endpoint.")*

### 3.2. Endpoints

---

#### **Resource: Users**

##### `POST /api/users/register` - Register a new user
*   **Description:** Creates a new user account.
*   **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "username": "string",
      "email": "string (email format)",
      "password": "string (min 8 characters)"
    }
    ```
*   **Responses:**
    *   `201 Created`: User successfully created.
        ```json
        {
          "userId": "string",
          "username": "string",
          "email": "string"
        }
        ```
    *   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input (e.g., missing fields, invalid email).
    *   `409 Conflict`: User with this email or username already exists.

##### `POST /api/auth/login` - Login a user
*   **Description:** Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.
*   **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "email": "string",
      "password": "string"
    }
    ```
*   **Responses:**
    *   `200 OK`: Login successful.
        ```json
        {
          "token": "string (jwt)",
          "userId": "string",
          "username": "string"
        }
        ```
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid credentials.

*(Continue this pattern for all your resources and endpoints: GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. Include path parameters, query parameters, request bodies, and example responses with status codes.)*

## 4. Process Flows

*(Describe key operational flows of your application. Diagrams (flowcharts, sequence diagrams) can be very helpful here if you can embed them or link to them.)*

### 4.1. User Registration & Login Flow
1.  User submits registration details to `POST /api/users/register`.
2.  Backend validates the input.
3.  If valid, backend hashes the password and stores the new user in the database.
4.  User receives a success response.
5.  User submits login credentials to `POST /api/auth/login`.
6.  Backend validates credentials against the database.
7.  If valid, backend generates a JWT and returns it to the user.

### 4.2. (Example: Order Processing Flow)
*(Describe another key process flow specific to your application.)*

## 5. Deployment

This project is configured for continuous deployment to an AWS EC2 instance using GitHub Actions. The workflow is defined in the file `.github/workflows/backend-deploy.yml`.

### 5.1. Trigger
The deployment workflow is triggered automatically on every `push` to the `main` branch.

### 5.2. Deployment Steps
1.  **Checkout Code:** The latest code from the `main` branch is checked out.
2.  **SSH to EC2:** The workflow securely connects to the EC2 instance using SSH.
3.  **Execute Deployment Script:** On the EC2 instance, the following commands are run:
    *   `cd /home/ec2-user/backend-repo`: Navigates to the project directory.
    *   `git pull origin main`: Pulls the latest changes from the `main` branch.
    *   `npm install`: Installs or updates project dependencies.
    *   `pm2 restart backend`: Restarts the backend application using PM2 (assuming the PM2 process is named `backend`).

### 5.3. Required GitHub Secrets
For the deployment to work, the following secrets must be configured in the GitHub repository settings (`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`):
*   `EC2_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of your EC2 instance.
*   `EC2_USER`: The username for SSH access to your EC2 instance (e.g., `ec2-user`).
*   `EC2_KEY`: The private SSH key used to connect to your EC2 instance.

## 7. License

*(Specify the license for your project, e.g., MIT License, Apache 2.0. If you don't have one, consider adding one.)*
